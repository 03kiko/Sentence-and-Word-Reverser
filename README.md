# Sentence and Word Reverser
 This C program reads a sentence from the standard input, splits it into words, and offers three options for processing the sentence:
 - Reverse the order of the words in the sentence, keeping the words intact (1);
 - Reverse the order of the letters in each word, keeping the word order intact (2);
 - Do both of the above (3);
     
The program prompts the user to choose one of these options, and then performs the selected operation on the input sentence. The output is printed to the standard output

## Usage
- Compile the program using a C compiler;
- Run the compiled executable;
- Enter a sentence of up to 100 characters;
- Choose one of the three options to process the sentence;
- View the output on the standard output.
